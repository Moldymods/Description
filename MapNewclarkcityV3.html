<h1>New Clark City V 3</h1>

<p>What&#39;s up guys? This is my first time here in MCPEDL. I&#39;m in a Filipino builder, I&#39;ve been building this city since December because I got bored of quarantine so I built Clark City. Hope you enjoy this new city!</p>

<p>This city includes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stadium</li>
	<li>SM mall(interior is not yet finished)</li>
	<li>Construction site</li>
	<li>Hospital</li>
	<li>Firestation</li>
	<li>Motel</li>
	<li>Shops</li>
	<li>Apartments</li>
	<li>Gas station</li>
	<li>Grove street</li>
	<li>Basketball court</li>
	<li>Theater</li>
	<li>Offices</li>

<p>You can download this for free. If you&#39;re going to post this on YouTube then please give credits. It is recommended to use Arcmodern Texture Pack if it is already in the world. The city is not designed for vanilla texture pack. Credits to Magistral texture owner. The city is not yet 100% complete!</p>
