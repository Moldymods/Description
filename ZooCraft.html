<h3>Zoo Craft</h3>

<p>With this mod, players can open a zoo in the Minecraft PE world. There are&nbsp;more than 20 animals&nbsp;that appear in the game. In addition, users will not find fantastic dragons or other mythical creatures, only real animals with existing prototypes in life:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Penguins who prefer a harsh cold climate;</li>
	<li>turtles walking slowly along the shores of reservoirs;</li>
	<li>graceful lions show by their appearance that they are the main ones among the animals;</li>
	<li>huge elephants;</li>
	<li>fast deer;</li>
	<li>dangerous crocodiles, ready to attack at any moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to natural generation, new mobs spawn in biomes that are natural to their habitat. Each animal is endowed with a unique character and behavioral characteristics.&nbsp;<strong>Some of them will be neutral towards players</strong>, and predators can be aggressive. It&rsquo;s just like in real life.</p>

<p>To get acquainted with the full list of real animals, users should download Zoo Craft mod for Minecraft PE and immerse themselves in the study of wildlife.</p>
